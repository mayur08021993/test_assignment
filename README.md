# assignment
This is test assignment : To find average of column from CSV file


Created REST API :

Method : post
Endpoint : /csvData/average/{columnNumber}
Content : csv file


Added positive Junit test case for endpoint

How did I test API
1) add csv file to be tested to form-data in postman
2) add column number to the form data as a Text
2) use endpoint /csvData/average

Couldn't complete below things due to time crunch:
  Add test cases for Service class
  Add negative test cases


I have also included CSV file that I used for testing
